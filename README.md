# Ben-Jerry

## Building an API for Ben &amp; Jerry's fans

### Objects handled:  JSON array of below structure

  "story": "Vanilla What Bar Crunch? We gave this flavor a new name to go with the new toffee bars weâ€™re using as part of our commitment to source Fairtrade Certified and non-GMO ingredients. We love it and know you will too!",

## Tasks Implemented

- Implemented a REST API with CRUD functionality with PosgressSQL as DB 
- Authenicated using JWT token 
- Documentation done using Swagger ( // Swagger json is not created properly at the time of writing )
- Extensive Testing is done using Post Main, Go Test and manual testing

## Architecural Decision

Table Definition is given below:

Product Table will hold the string fields
Ingredients Table will hold ( Product ID, Ingredient ID)
SourcingValue Table will hold ( Product ID, Sourcing Value ID) 
IngredientIndex Table will (Ingredient ID, Value)
SourcingValue Table will (Sourcing Value ID, Value)


### Design Choices Considered

Efficient Storage and Retrieval of values based on the Values ( Ingredients , Sourcing Values) by keeping in Separate Tables


PreProcess of Values in Ingredients :

"butter (cream","salt)"   - Instead of saving 2 values , mapped to Single value in table "butter (cream salt) 


"liquid sugar (sugar","water)" - mapped to "liquid sugar (sugar water )

Database Used: Posgress SQL ( Used PostgreSQL as a Service , Elephant SQL ) - DB instance is up and running - Testing is possible by running application locally  

## How Ingredients / Sourcing Values are updated since it is kept in two tables

Old Values : Array of Ingredients present in DB
New Values : Array of Ingredients given to the endpoint

Compare Old Values and New Values :

Make a Decision on Which Values to be Deleted 
Make a Decision on Which Values to be Inserted 
Make a Decision on Which Values not touched

Example :

Old Values : "ingredients": [
    _"cream",_
    _"skim milk",_
    _"liquid sugar",_
    _"water",_
    __"sugar",__
    __"coconut oil" ]__
    
 New Values : "ingredients": [
    _"cream",_
    _"skim milk",_
    _"liquid sugar",_
    _"water",_
    __"black sugar",__
    __"coco powder"__
    ]
    
  Rows Untouched during Update :  [ "cream" , "skim milk" , "liquid sugar", "water" ]
  
  Rows to be Deleted:   [ "sugar", "coconut oil" ]
  
  Rows to be Inserted: ["black sugar", "coco powder" ]
  
  
  
  If the indexes are available for black sugar and coco powder in the ingredients index table , update only ingredients table
  
  If the indexs are not available for black sugar and coco powder in the ingredients index table , create entries for black sugar and coco powder in the ingredients table and then update the ingredients table
